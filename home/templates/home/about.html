<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hey there, I'm Zack.</p>
<br>
<p>
I'm the creator of this website, my brands (like ZackHub.com), music,
programs, apps, etc.
<p>
  <br>
<p>
I'm a lot of things, like life itself. I find it easier to define who I am <br>
through my skills, results, and interests. So first, what better way to <br>
display skills than with skillbars? (Maybe skill trees, but these are good for
now)
<p>
<!-- TODO: Add skillbars here.
<div class="skillbars">

<h2>I know big words.</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Yep, you read that correctly.</strong></p>
<p>To impress you, I wanted to
share some of the big words I know, mostly because I don't really flaunt them
around anywhere else besides when they're actually needed.</p>
<p>Here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Neuroplasticity</p></li>
</ul>
