Previously today after some AMAZING morning sex (that I haven't had in a while, just recently as me and my woman got our sleeping schedules on point), and it being my first day off in a while, I was really thinking about some of the things I enjoy doing.</p>\r\n<p>I have kind of a list, here it is:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>I'm really good at creating music. REALLY good.</li>\r\n<li>I'm also really good at videogames and am a fast learner in this area (The Elder Scrolls: Legends and Borderlands are some of my favorite games ever).</li>\r\n<li>I'm a developer, and I love Parkour</li>\r\n<li>This is actually number one, the others are just extra hobbies, but my relationship is one of the most inspiring and amazing things in my life. I love my woman (currently fianc&eacute;) with all of my mind, body, heart, soul. The sex, the teamwork, the synergy, the growth I gain from it. It's absolutely one of the most amazing parts of life as I type this.</li>\r\n<li>I'm a Developer now, I have skills to program automations to take over processes, and now I have the skills to share those tools with the world one websites (&amp; make them attractive).</li>\r\n<li>I'm also an Entrepreneur, which is the main reason I'm wanting to be a programmer in the first place.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Really though (to point number 6), no matter how many times I try to be \"free\" and experience \"freedom\", money is something that comes back to bite me in the ass. Especially the lack there of.</p>\r\n<p>Anyways, a conversation on stupid beliefs and sayings that got stuck in my subconscious about money is for another post.</p>\r\n<p>At this point in my life I'm only starting my success. I made my first $1k in business in less than 3 months of only just beginning being in business. I'm either quickly approaching or have already made my second $k in business. (I just googled why we call a thousand dollars $1k. Interesting read.)</p>\r\n<p>This whole week, and a few weeks before, my brain has been on fire. Thoughts of fears, feelings of being numb, also accomplishment, anxiety, etc. were filling my brain. I'm quite sure my body and brain were inflamed from the amount of movement I haven't been doing since I decided to build my website.</p>\r\n<p>I've been doing nothing but working on my website &amp; working with my first sustainable client this month.</p>\r\n<p>Life has always been something that has been kind of trippy for me, so when I'm doing the same things everyday and still not feeling great, working towards a result (especially in coding), life kind of flys by in this time. The same with playing video games. Same with music.</p>\r\n<p>Living in the now is something that's easier said than done, and also easy to be forgotten.</p>\r\n<p>There are periods when I really want my brain to just shut the fuck up and let me live, breathe, be in the&nbsp; moment and just enjoy what I have right in front of me.</p>\r\n<p>My mind and attention were somewhat shattered. Since my last shroom trip about 4 months, sometimes life is trippy. It's been trippy even before that, but just cynical or not useful thoughts before that were populating and spinning their wheels on things that were only causing me internal suffering.</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, this blog is getting deep. Even for me, so now, let's lighten it up a bit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>My intention in creating this post is to comment on creating a rich life.</strong></p>\r\n<p>All of this stuff that I feel has been happening to me is only doing so because I choose to allow it.</p>\r\n<p>How am I going to change it? Easy... ish. Choice.</p>\r\n<p>I choose to create a life that is rich and meaningful and allows me to do things that I enjoy and make the biggest impact possible.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, right now I'm in a bit of a grind mode. But because it's Sunday, my self-appointed day off and reflection/strategy day, I'm developing to put more time for myself and my health into my calendar.</p>\r\n<p>I made it a point not to touch videogames until the end of the year, nor eat bread or added sugar, as well as some other habits that weren't helping me.</p>\r\n<p>Right now, with the building of my website, I'm building a platform to market everything that I'm doing off of, and for me it's FULLY customizable because it's all custom code!</p>\r\n<p>Now, isn't this too much?</p>\r\n<p>Aren't you only supposed to pick one profession, one skill in life and stick with that?</p>\r\n<p>FUCK NO. You only have one life, and life is huge! Sure, there are some things that are probably smarter to invest in at first before you don the other things, but find what is meaningful and useful to you and in your life and do that!</p>\r\n<p>For me, that includes:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Spending time with my loved ones and building my relationships, as well as growing in amazing friends and network.</li>\r\n<li>Taking care of my health and consuming healthy foods</li>\r\n<li>Playing the best videogames (mostly RPGs and CCGs for me), but doing it in a way that can also make you money by streaming, which requires a laptop that can handle it, which requires money, unless you can twitch stream from your phone... hmm.</li>\r\n<li>Travelling and moving from Airbnb to Airbnb, or investing in real estate and interior designing to your tastes, your architectural style, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Learn how to start a business (like a Freelancing Business for example, just to start), and learn things like how to lead &amp; manage a team, delegate tasks, earn clients, and make money with a team that you brought together and love.</li>\r\n<li>Create music, and as you build your automation skills with programming, you can do things like automatically publish it on soundcloud, host it on your website (which I do plan on doing), etc. And play literally ANY instrument by using a cool tool like the ROLI Seaboard/other boards they have (they're not a sponsor, just go and check them out. I really wish they were a sponsor though, so if you can help me out with that that'd be great).</li>\r\n<li>Start gardening and build a healthy garden, or whatever kind of garden your interested that is also useful and meaningful to you.</li>\r\n<li>Make an amazing family with the most beautiful and connected partner you've ever met in your life (for me, that's my perfect woman Olga).</li>\r\n<li>Learn Herbalism more like you did when you were younger (ok, that was just my experience and I still love the idea of being a real life Witch Doctor).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The point is, there are so many options out there.</p>\r\n<p>I know what it's like to be in a shitty spot, and yes, money is a huge part of it.</p>\r\n<p>But living a rich life is about doing things that you enjoy and that interest you, even if that means putting all of your time into one thing!</p>\r\n<p>I'm good at a lot of shit, but not because I isolate on certain skills all the time, because I choose to think about life in a way that brings everything, and the right things, the things that are most important to me, together!</p>\r\n<p>Also, my mentor Ryan Donaldson taught me something called Criteria for Success in life.</p>\r\n<p>I'll make another post on that most likely, but I'm going to list mine for later reference:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Improved Health</li>\r\n<li>Increased Freedom</li>\r\n<li>Relationship Fulfillment</li>\r\n<li>Massive Positive World Impact</li>\r\n<li>Increased Creation Capacity</li>\r\n<li>Increased Feelings of Joy</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>As long as the actions I'm doing are moving me forward in each of these areas, that's my definition of a rich &amp; meaningful life.</p>\r\n<p>Another way of putting it is this: Dive into areas that interest you and move closer to something I'm proud to be able to quite Rick Sanchez on:</p>\r\n<p>\"Ability to do anything, but only whenever I want... Yeah that sounds like the job for me.\"</p>\r\n<p>Keep living your life to the fullest, whatever that looks like for you.</p>\r\n<p>And since your here, what are some things that you haven't been doing that you'd like to add back into your life to make it more rich? I'd love to read this. Let me know in the comments below.</p>\r\n<p>I love you guys.

Yesterday was literally perfect for all of the day, except the end.</p>\r\n<p>We went and walked to a coffeehouse to do some work. Normally I go alone, but she wanted to go with me, and I said it was fine. I love her, and pretty much in general it's fine for her to come with me and I love when she chooses to do so.</p>\r\n<p>She was in a great mood once she finally finished all of her work. On the walk there I was still pushing out my fearful/unuseful &amp; destructive thoughts. I've been doing this for days now, and they kept getting louder and louder, but I've been blocking them out and not allowing them in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I've tried the whole letting them be and sitting there thing, but that didn't work. It only let them there longer.</p>\r\n<p>There's a saying at the end of one of the passages in \"As a Man Thinketh\" called \"Serenity\". It goes like this:</p>\r\n<p>\"...&nbsp;<strong>Self Control is Strength. Right Thought is Mastery. Calmness is Power.</strong>\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At this moment, I'm in the stage of strength.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I understand that in some belief systems people say it's \"bad to push thoughts away\", but then give no alternative. \"Thoughts become things\", ok, not all the time, so that's false. \"Some thoughts become things when you act on them.\" There we go, that sounds more accurate. But what about emotions? \"Yuu need to clear out the emotions before you can change your thoughts.\" Ok, but the thoughts are generating those emotions.&nbsp;<em>They're so strong sometimes...</em></p>\r\n<p><em>But recently I've been getting stronger.</em></p>\r\n<p>It's fucking hard.</p>\r\n<p>And the only thing that really seems to heal me is to bring it up with my woman.</p>\r\n<p>Here's the thing though: Why the fuck should she have to deal with something I KNOW is self-generated. She consistently does a lot of amazing things for me and our relationship, as do I. In fact, if there was a lack of fear this wouldn't have happened in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>My brain won't shutup sometimes and my thoughts are so creative, so painful, so automatic that sometimes I don't know what to do.</p>\r\n<p>I love my woman. She's the most important person to me who isn't myself.</p>\r\n<p>At some point you have to acknowledge that if it was really an issue with your partner, it's something that would be fair and helpful to resolve. And that has happened. Sometimes it's even hard and change does happens. Not every conversation feels easy.</p>\r\n<p>But this shit, this time it was all me. Actually, a lot of times it was all me. If I didn't have fears, most of this shit would be irrelevnt in my life.</p>\r\n<p>Also, expectations.</p>\r\n<p>Expecting one person to heal you everytime, because they're the most important person to you, \"the one\".</p>\r\n<p>Yes, I am with my baby forever, and she is the same. This shit is hard, and it's something I've been dealing with since even before the relationship, which was also my first real one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I don't want to keep hurting her and letting these fears ruining my relationship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I've never cheated on her, and I never will. Same on her side.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What's left?</p>\r\n<p>Let go of expectations of her, be present (actively), and accept and appreciate what I have.</p>\r\n<p>The same way I generated these fears internally, the same way I can generate healing internally to deal with them. It's my inner world, she shouldn't have to carry the weight of my inner turmoil &amp; shit.</p>\r\n<p>Deal with the fears. Not allowing them is one step in the right direction that does drain energy, sure, but it's worth it to not deal with them when it's not appropriate timing. Sure, hiring a therapist or asking a friend to just be present,&nbsp; that's what can help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I've let go of a lot of things for myself and my relationship. I've never let go of anything that didn't serve both. Some of those included:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>High level of perversion (of course sex is still amazing and I still ackonwledge there are physically and personality wise attractive people, but in my mind stripping down most attractive woman I see to being naked or something similar, it really pulls away my intention from growing other areas of my life. Without this, I've been able to be more present in my relationship, with my friends, with meeting new people, with my work, etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Trying to manually lead someone instead of empowering them to be strong on their own. This one took me a while, and while in some cases it's useful, it's not scalable, nor what I want in the long run.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>A lot of at home habits like leaving the toilet seat open, more degrees of selfishness I didn't realize I had, etc.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>I've grown so much in my relationship, because I've chosen to be the type of man who is strong enough to be in a loving relationship with an amazing woman. My amazing woman. My woman. My queen. My wife. My family. My friends, everything.</p>\r\n<p>There were already periods of hell and I'm tired of experiencing them over and over again without reason.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>To my woman:</em></p>\r\n<p>I love you baby. I'm done hurting you and I'm taking even more responsibility to be the man I've always wanted, and you've helped me grow in this way more than anyone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>To my friends, family, &amp; readers:</em></p>\r\n<p>Relationships are hard work sometimes. For both sides, be strong and don't give up, no matter what, when you really understand that you've found someone amazing for you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I really have no idea what trauma or whatever else might be causing such fearful thoughts &amp; anxiety, for all I know it could even be a health thing (there are a lot of really smart people who had their brains scanned and found literal holes in their brain).</p>\r\n<p>I'm going to be doing my own healing, and doing literally anything else than bringing my own shit into my relationship. Those parts are for me to take care of. Of course, if there really is relationship conflict, I will still deal with that. But if it's really only being generated from me, that parts mine.</p>\r\n<p>That's all I got for this one.</p>\r\n<p>I love you all,<em>&nbsp;thank you for reading.</em></p>", "tag": 2, "created_date": "2020-03-09T20:41:46.426Z", "published_date": "2019-11-22T10:27:27Z", "display": true}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 3, "fields": {"author": 1, "image": "images/IMG_1521_7recWnf.JPG", "title": "This Is What I Like to Call: A Start", "body": "<p>This is a blog post about me being tired af but earning a dank amount of money (finally) and how I hit my goal of hitting $4.2k a month.</p>\r\n<p>My life has changed a lot since my last post.</p>\r\n<p>It's 2020 now. Olga and I are a week away from getting married (literally, 1 week) and I actually have a lot of consistently paying clients.</p>\r\n<p>This post is about a goal I set and the evolution of my financial goals, because finally I was able to create something realistic and I'm very close to actually hitting it.</p>\r\n<p>Previously, my financial goals were huge, somewhere around the millions (and I can't say they're not anymore, just I don't actively spend time focusing on them for now) and my sources of income weren't even close. When I was working 9 to 5 jobs, I was making I think maximum $200-500ish a week, and most of these jobs I pretty much hated (except working at The Sunflower Caf&eacute; in Fairhope Alabama, I loved the staff, the food, and the setup. Shoutout to my friends Troy and Dominique for making that such a wonderful working experience. I love you both dearly). This period of my life was pretty shitty financially. Every week I'd pretty much end up broke. I was almost homeless at one point, and at another point I was in startup mode living with my friend Anand in a literal warehouse (#startuplife?)</p>\r\n<p><strong>My new goal?&nbsp;</strong>My new more recent goal that I set last June goes as follows:</p>\r\n<p><em>Create a successful Freelancing Business that creates 1.4x of you and Olga's expenses ($4.2k within a month working maximum 20 hours a week)</em></p>\r\n<p>For those of you who don't know, Olga is my fiance (at the time of me writing this), and soon to be wife. You can learn more about her at zackplauche.com/olga.</p>\r\n<p><strong>This is a really specific goal.</strong>&nbsp;Not only is it specific, but it's also&nbsp;<em><strong>useful to how I want to live my life.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Why? Because what fucking other numbers should I base my income off of other than my expenses (or at least ideal expenses).</p>\r\n<p>That's the point, there is none.</p>\r\n<p>I'm not saying that I don't think about things like, for example, how the fuck am I going to be able to afford to live an extremely fulfilling life with Olga and raise tiny humans in several years without at least a $400k a year income?</p>\r\n<p>That question is not going anywhere, and will likely reside in my mind until I'm at that point. Right now, however, I am not there yet.</p>\r\n<p>My goal came out of a necessity, and partially through strong logic that I learned from my mentor Ryan Donaldson.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How I Created This Goal</strong></p>\r\n<p>There were a lot of things I specifically wanted out of my income, call it \"Criteria for Success\" if you will.</p>\r\n<p>I wanted the goal to give me the freedom and ability to...</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Take care of myself as an individual (without any help from Olga)</li>\r\n<li>Cover both Olga and I at a survival level (quality food, shelter, bills, etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Invest in my earning capacity (skills, books, etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Enjoy life and my relationship with Olga (have time, dates, trips, gifts, etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Pay my taxes</li>\r\n<li>Have enough left over to weather the storms (in case of injury, law suit, etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Be able earn money from anywhere on the planet with Wifi</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Part of that has to do with money, partly with time, and partly with location flexibility.</p>\r\n<p>How did I move towards accomplishing this?</p>\r\n<p>First...</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. I had an identity change into a CEO.</strong></p>\r\n<p>This part is a bit hard to replicate, and really it was pretty weird how it happened. TLDR version is I decided to take full responsibility for my life. Here's the story:</p>\r\n<p>On May 20th, 2019, I was living in Moldova on my own for a month (Moldova is basically the Mississippi of Europe, and I had to stay out of Ukraine for 3 months because my Visa expired). Olga had to go back to the Ukraine to take care of business stuff, and she'd be back in a month. If you've been following my story thus far, you're aware that my relationship initially brought me to face a lot of parts of myself that were causing me a ton of pain and relationship troubles. I was personally fucking up my relationship with the woman I loved because of my internal fears and thoughts that I was letting rule my life and didn't know how to control them.</p>\r\n<p>Again, Olga left to Ukraine and was coming back in a month. I had a fuck ton of dealing with myself and growing to do in this period time. It was really one of the most stressful periods of my life, because how the fuck are you supposed to deal with stuff that's internal on your own? I didn't have time, and it felt like I didn't have patience. I knew there was a chance that if I didn't grow faster than I've ever done before, I might not be strong enough for Olga &amp; I's relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That was a new level of hell for me. Moldova in my opinion is not the best place to be spiritually. It's a very unmotivating and kind of sad country. Of course, there were good people, some good restaurants, etc. But overall it's not somewhere you want to live for more than maybe a week max (much less 3 months).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The company I was working with at the time wasn't even kind of consistent with payment at the time, and both Olga and I relied on it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also, just to add to the fun mess, when Olga left, pretty much every single day I had insomnia and couldn't sleep for more than about 4 hours max. So what happens when you're broke, depressed, sleep deprived, and have a relationship that you care about more than anything else in the world, but there's no guarantee your partner is going to stay with you?</p>\r\n<p>Looks like it's time to grow, and I had a fuck ton of discomfort and solitude to help me do exactly that.</p>\r\n<p>The first thing I knew I had to do if I wanted any chance of not doing anything stupid or have some annoying emotional outbreak that I'd likely call someone or send over text, I was going to need to take care of my health.</p>\r\n<p>Every day, I was exercising, doing my best to eat heatlhy, taking supplements, and doing everything I could to get back to a solid sleep. During my freetime, I was either reading, messaging Olga, reflecting, doing some work tasks, just something to keep myself going and hopefully exhaust me at the end of the day enough to sleep. I'd say the largest part of this specific time period was actually 1. Getting enough sunlight everyday, and 2. getting into nature. There was a huge park just a short run from my Airbnb at the time, so I decided to go there pretty much every single day to workout.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One of the days in the huge nature filled park, I meditated. I was so stressed out. I couldn't really trust the CEO's word and reliability at payment at the time, and all of that stress and all of the ideas and insights I've collected previously finally broke me. I somehow came to the park as a stressed out, depressed, lost Zack and came out as Zack the CEO and the Capital raisor. Now, I don't know how the fuck that happened. Before I always thought that calling yourself a CEO or Salesman or Capital raisor, whatever, was just affirmation for people who didn't feel that way, and that's not innaccurate. In this case though, something just switched or broke inside me (maybe an old part of me that was holding me back just died?) and every cell in my body was energized with the title CEO. I somehow broke while sitting on a park bench meditating in a forested park into a Chief Executive Officer of my own company.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I didn't have my own company at all. I only had the idea, I knew how to set awesome goals after a ton of trial and error, and now, I had the identity level change. I would say it happened spontaneously, but there was literally years of work and trial and error and experience in everything that I was doing that built up to that point. Somehow the epic killer cocktail caused a cataclysmic reaction in my brain to send me to start building.</p>\r\n<p>Not everything was so straight forward from that point, and there were still several moments that I wanted to give up almost on life in general, but there were a few facts that were there:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>I was in the next best shape of my life I've ever been (physically anyway)</li>\r\n<li>I had a solid plan that was only the seed and drive to start my freelancing business.</li>\r\n<li>Olga was coming back soon, and I still had to get stronger.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>This pretty much concludes the first part of what happened. I had to continue taking more and more responsibility for my life and actually stick with it.</p>\r\n<p>Now, that was useful for me, and again, and I'm going to give you some lessons and insight bullet points you can take away, but I have no idea how I actually just snapped into a CEO who had to take responsibility for my life. I assume it came mostly from my relationship (which was my first real long term relationsihp I've ever had, and believe me, there were a lot of interesting complexities going on here) and the first desire and experience of my life to take care of the woman whose been nothing but loyal, loved me more than anyone else in my life, and matched me better than not any other person but also any other woman I've ever met, and bring the family we were building \"the world\" so to speak.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Here's what I think you could take away from this part of my life:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>In all parts of life,&nbsp;<strong>take care of your mental health</strong>. This will, in general, allow you to more easily make it through the challenges of life. I could give you a ton of tips, but I got most of mine from the book&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The Ultramind Solution</strong></span>&nbsp;by Dr. Mark Hyman. Overall and in general, he is my top mentor on Diet, Nutrition, Exercise, and Sleep, and how you can pretty much fix most mental health problems just by treating your body better. You can checkout his book here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UltraMind-Solution-Broken-Brain-Healing/dp/0743570480\">https://www.amazon.com/UltraMind-Solution-Broken-Brain-Healing/dp/0743570480</a></li>\r\n<li>Realize that, regardless of all of the shitty sayings that are out there, thoughts are only thoughts. Say this:&nbsp;<strong>Not all thoughts become things</strong>. Now say it again, but out loud and louder:&nbsp;<strong>NOT ALL THOUGHTS BECOME THINGS.&nbsp;</strong>You can yell it again if that feels appropriate.&nbsp;Thoughts can be confusing, and this was a time when I had a massive amount of anxiety where my thoughts would completely drag me out of the present moment into some situation that would be painful to me. (To be super raw and honest here, I had a HUGE irrational fear of infidelity or being abondoned in my relationships. My mom cheated on my Dad when I was younger, and growing up my Dad was typically on the schools side instead of mine, or if I did something wrong he took away my phone or something that I cared about in pretty much every situation where I did something wrong. I was having fears and nightmares even before my relationship about being cheated on or abondoned. Oddly enough, a 3rd of the woman I've slept with actually were in relationships at the time of me sleeping with them. I've found that this fear mostly comes when you don't feel that you yourself are worthy of love, real, loyal, long lasting love of a partner with whom you can trust 100%, especially when you find that partner who actually does love you in this way. I can't speak for every relationship, but in mine and in this case, my partner was and has been loyal to me completely. Also, at this time, because I'm the type of person that likes to research things I fear until I feel I know enough about them to feel good enough, I did a ton of research on what causes infidelity, and pretty much the exact opposite of all of those signs were present. If you're interseted in relationship advice, feel free to email me at zackknowspython@gmail.com or in the comments section that should below this post at some point in the near future.). Just know, you're stronger than your thoughts and you won't act on every thought you have. Take care of your mental health and quiet your OCD. By the way, fun fact, if you're ever having some kind of intrusive or obsessive thinking to the point where you start to overthink everything, and you're a straight person, you may find yourself in the situation where you're overthinking your sexuality. There was actually an article I found about something called HOCD, which is having OCD to the point where you're having thoughts that bring you to question your own sexualtiy. Most likely, your sexual orientation you've had for a long time, and if you've been straight all of your life, you most likely still are. Your mind is just super loud and active right now. Learn how to cool it off and eventually the thoughts will go away.</li>\r\n<li>If you feel lost in your life, realize this:&nbsp;<strong>You're not going to \"find yourself\", you need to create yourself.</strong>&nbsp;You are the creator of your life. There's no god telling you what to do. You are your own \"God\". You are the universe itself (literally stardust that transformed overtime into what we know as a human that can eat, sleep, fuck, piss, and shit.&nbsp;<em><strong>Congratulations, your poops are stardust and the universe too</strong></em>). You need to practice what you want to create, at least at a basic level. For example, if you have shitty mental health, or physical health right now, say this out loud as an affirmation:&nbsp;<strong>\"I choose to create health.\"</strong>&nbsp;If you are broke or feel you have a lack of resources, say&nbsp;<strong>\"I choose to create wealth.\"</strong>&nbsp;If you haven't been living honestly (things such as lying to others, making promises you can't keep), say this&nbsp;<strong>\"I choose to create integrity within myself.\"</strong>&nbsp;If you're relationship has gone pretty shitty so hard, instead of giving up, say this:&nbsp;<strong>\"I choose to create an amazing, loving, fulfilling relationship with {the person whom you're in a relationship with, this can also even be yourself}.\"</strong>&nbsp;If you're feeling anxious, say&nbsp;<strong>\"I choose to create inner peace.\"</strong>&nbsp;So, what does it mean when you choose to create something?&nbsp;<em><strong>What it doesn't mean</strong></em>&nbsp;is that immediately you'll get what you're creating instantly.&nbsp;<strong>It means that you're telling yourself, your subconscoius mind, and the universe</strong>&nbsp;(and anyone who's near you if they're listening)&nbsp;<strong>that you are making the choice to create something in your life.</strong>&nbsp;How does that happen? That's for you to figure out. But choosing to DO something, anything, means you're taking the action to create that. One last one you can say if you're not feeling confident, you can say&nbsp;<strong>\"I choose to create long lasting Confidence within myself.\"</strong>&nbsp;It all starts with a choose to create.&nbsp;A suggested follow up question you can ask to each of these is \"How?\"</li>\r\n<li>Finally, this is pretty much in general,&nbsp;<strong>always seek the truth and don't make assumptions</strong>. You can typically always talk things out and seek to cultivate relationships where honesty and respect is part of the foundation. Otherwise your fears can have much more strength, and most likely you'll even believe them as truth, even if they didn't take place in reality, only inside you head. That doesn't mean you can't or won't get emotionally be affected by your thoughts initially as you're experiencing this sort of thing, this just means treat whatever thoughts or fears that really intrude, even&nbsp;if they're painful, as only thoughts and fears. That is, they're literally nothing until acted upon in the real world. From my understanding, especially in new relationships, fears are normal until you really have a lot of experience in that not being the case and there have been hardships and true love and loyalty have been shown, at least for those of us who choose to be in monogamous relationships. This takes work, and it won't happen overnight, but eventually if you can live this way, in a way where you can have assumptions. Remember, if you fully trust someone or something, you won't be fearing that thing anymore. It's like how you don't really think about gravity while your on earth after you initially learn the concept. You just accept it after it's been proven true. That doesn't mean gravity can't fail if the Earth breaks apart somehow, and that doesn't mean that your fear can't happen. Sometimes humans bite our tongue and technically that should never happen, but it can. You can just understand that literally anything could happen at any moment in time. A meteor could blow up the Earth. You could win the lottery. Etc. But having accurate data is the only way to truly know what's going on in every situation. Use data before building strategies and predicting.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Ok, that was a lot for the first part. Still reading and paying attention? Let's keep going.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Figure out your expenses so you can know what to charge.</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "tag": 3, "created_date": "2020-03-09T20:44:32.058Z", "published_date":
