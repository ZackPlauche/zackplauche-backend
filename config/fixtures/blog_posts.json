      "body": "<p><strong>What is real strength for a man?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I've been dealing with fear/anxiety in my relationship, pretty much since my relationship started.</p>\r\n<p>Things have been getting more stable overall, I haven't been letting my brain fuck me as much.</p>\r\n<p>For the first time, pretty much in our entire relationship, we had a solid 2 weeks of no interruption.</p>\r\n<p>Then, yesterday. Yesterday was literally perfect for all of the day, except the end.</p>\r\n<p>We went and walked to a coffeehouse to do some work. Normally I go alone, but she wanted to go with me, and I said it was fine. I love her, and pretty much in general it's fine for her to come with me and I love when she chooses to do so.</p>\r\n<p>She was in a great mood once she finally finished all of her work. On the walk there I was still pushing out my fearful/unuseful &amp; destructive thoughts. I've been doing this for days now, and they kept getting louder and louder, but I've been blocking them out and not allowing them in.</p>\r\n<p>I've tried the whole letting them be and sitting there thing, but that didn't work. It only let them there longer.</p>\r\n<p>There's a saying at the end of one of the passages in \"As a Man Thinketh\" called \"Serenity\". It goes like this:</p>\r\n<p>\"...Self Control is Strength. Right Thought is Mastery. Calmness is Power.\"</p>\r\n<p>At this moment, I'm in the stage of strength.</p>\r\n<p>I understand that in some belief systems people say it's \"bad to push thoughts away\", but then give no alternative. \"Thoughts become things\", ok, not all the time, so that's false. \"Some thoughts become things when you act on them.\" There we go, that sounds more accurate. But what about emotions? \"You need to clear out the emotions before you can change your thoughts.\" Ok, but the thoughts are generating those emotions.They're so strong sometimes...</p>\r\n<p>But recently I've been getting stronger.</p>\r\n<p>It's fucking hard.</p>\r\n<p>And the only thing that really seems to heal me is to bring it up with my woman.</p>\r\n<p>Here's the thing though: Why the fuck should she have to deal with something I KNOW is self-generated. She consistently does a lot of amazing things for me and our relationship, as do I. In fact, if there was a lack of fear this wouldn't have happened in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>My brain won't shutup sometimes and my thoughts are so creative, so painful, so automatic that sometimes I don't know what to do.</p>\r\n<p>I love my woman. She's the most important person to me who isn't myself.</p>\r\n<p>At some point you have to acknowledge that if it was really an issue with your partner, it's something that would be fair and helpful to resolve. And that has happened. Sometimes it's even hard and change does happens. Not every conversation feels easy.</p>\r\n<p>But this shit, this time it was all me. Actually, a lot of times it was all me. If I didn't have fears, most of this shit would be irrelevnt in my life.</p>\r\n<p>Also, expectations.</p>\r\n<p>Expecting one person to heal you everytime, because they're the most important person to you, \"the one\".</p>\r\n<p>Yes, I am with my baby forever, and she is the same. This shit is hard, and it's something I've been dealing with since even before the relationship, which was also my first real one.</p>\r\n<p>I don't want to keep hurting her and letting these fears ruining my relationship.</p>\r\n<p>I've never cheated on her, and I never will. Same on her side.</p>\r\n<p>What's left?</p>\r\n<p>Let go of expectations of her, be present (actively), and accept and appreciate what I have.</p>\r\n<p>The same way I generated these fears internally, the same way I can generate healing internally to deal with them. It's my inner world, she shouldn't have to carry the weight of my inner turmoil &amp; shit.</p>\r\n<p>Deal with the fears. Not allowing them is one step in the right direction that does drain energy, sure, but it's worth it to not deal with them when it's not appropriate timing. Sure, hiring a therapist or asking a friend to just be present, that's what can help.</p>\r\n<p>I've let go of a lot of things for myself and my relationship. I've never let go of anything that didn't serve both. Some of those included:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>High level of perversion (of course sex is still amazing and I still ackonwledge there are physically and personality wise attractive people, but in my mind stripping down most attractive woman I see to being naked or something similar, it really pulls away my intention from growing other areas of my life. Without this, I've been able to be more present in my relationship, with my friends, with meeting new people, with my work, etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Trying to manually lead someone instead of empowering them to be strong on their own. This one took me a while, and while in some cases it's useful, it's not scalable, nor what I want in the long run.</li>\r\n<li>A lot of at home habits like leaving the toilet seat open, more degrees of selfishness I didn't realize I had, etc.</li>\r\n<li>I've grown so much in my relationship, because I've chosen to be the type of man who is strong enough to be in a loving relationship with an amazing woman. My amazing woman. My woman. My queen. My wife. My family. My friends, everything.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>There were already periods of hell and I'm tired of experiencing them over and over again without reason.</p>\r\n<p><em>To my woman:</em></p>\r\n<p>I love you baby. I'm done hurting you and I'm taking even more responsibility to be the man I've always wanted, and you've helped me grow in this way more than anyone.</p>\r\n<p><em>To my friends, family, &amp; readers:</em></p>\r\n<p>Relationships are hard work sometimes. For both sides, be strong and don't give up, no matter what, when you really understand that you've found someone amazing for you.</p>\r\n<p>I really have no idea what trauma or whatever else might be causing such fearful thoughts &amp; anxiety, for all I know it could even be a health thing (there are a lot of really smart people who had their brains scanned and found literal holes in their brain).</p>\r\n<p>I'm going to be doing my own healing, and doing literally anything else than bringing my own shit into my relationship. Those parts are for me to take care of. Of course, if there really is relationship conflict, I will still deal with that. But if it's really only being generated from me, that parts mine.</p>\r\n<p>That's all I got for this one.</p>\r\n<p>I love you all,thank you for reading.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "body": "<p>I wanted to write this since , well, earlier today.</p>\r\n<p>And since I found out how to add linebreaks to my content on this Django website I built from scratch, &amp; I don't have any other baseline typing mockups, I'm going to use the fuck out of them.</p>\r\n<p>I'm working on adding richness to my life.</p>\r\n<p>Today I was watching some of Ezra Firestone's content and noticed he had a Ukulele in the background. Previously today after some AMAZING morning sex (that I haven't had in a while, just recently as me and my woman got our sleeping schedules on point), and it being my first day off in a while, I was really thinking about some of the things I enjoy doing.</p>\r\n<p>I have kind of a list, here it is:&lt;ol&gt;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>&nbsp; I'm really good at creating music. REALLY good.</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; I'm also really good at videogames and am a fast learner in this area (The Elder Scrolls: Legends and Borderlands are some of my favorite games ever).</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; I'm a developer, and I love Parkour</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; This is actually number one, the others are just extra hobbies, but my relationship is one of the most inspiring and amazing things in my life. I love my woman (currently fianc&amp;eacute;) with all of my mind, body, heart, soul. The sex, the teamwork, the synergy, the growth I gain from it. It's absolutely one of the most amazing parts of life as I type this.</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; I'm a Developer now, I have skills to program automations to take over processes, and now I have the skills to share those tools with the world one websites (&amp; make them attractive).</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; I'm also an Entrepreneur, which is the main reason I'm wanting to be a programmer in the first place.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Really though (to point number 6), no matter how many times I try to be \"free\" and experience \"freedom\", money is something that comes back to bite me in the ass. Especially the lack there of.</p>\r\n<p>Anyways, a conversation on stupid beliefs and sayings that got stuck in my subconscious about money is for another post.</p>\r\n<p>At this point in my life I'm only starting my success. I made my first $1k in business in less than 3 months of only just beginning being in business. I'm either quickly approaching or have already made my second $k in business. (I just googled why we call a thousand dollars $1k. Interesting read.)</p>\r\n<p>This whole week, and a few weeks before, my brain has been on fire. Thoughts of fears, feelings of being numb, also accomplishment, anxiety, etc. were filling my brain. I'm quite sure my body and brain were inflamed from the amount of movement I haven't been doing since I decided to build my website.</p>\r\n<p>I've been doing nothing but working on my website &amp; working with my first sustainable client this month.</p>\r\n<p>Life has always been something that has been kind of trippy for me, so when I'm doing the same things everyday and still not feeling great, working towards a result (especially in coding), life kind of flys by in this time. The same with playing video games. Same with music.</p>\r\n<p>Living in the now is something that's easier said than done, and also easy to be forgotten.</p>\r\n<p>There are periods when I really want my brain to just shut the fuck up and let me live, breathe, be in the moment and just enjoy what I have right in front of me.</p>\r\n<p>My mind and attention were somewhat shattered. Since my last shroom trip about 4 months, sometimes life is trippy. It's been trippy even before that, but just cynical or not useful thoughts before that were populating and spinning their wheels on things that were only causing me internal suffering.</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, this blog is getting deep. Even for me, so now, let's lighten it up a bit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>My intention in creating this post is to comment on creating a rich life.</strong></p>\r\n<p>All of this stuff that I feel has been happening to me is only doing so because I choose to allow it.</p>\r\n<p>How am I going to change it? Easy... ish. Choice.</p>\r\n<p>I choose to create a life that is rich and meaningful and allows me to do things that I enjoy and make the biggest impact possible.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, right now I'm in a bit of a grind mode. But because it's Sunday, my self-appointed day off and reflection/strategy day, I'm developing to put more time for myself and my health into my calendar.</p>\r\n<p>I made it a point not to touch videogames until the end of the year, nor eat bread or added sugar, as well as some other habits that weren't helping me.</p>\r\n<p>Right now, with the building of my website, I'm building a platform to market everything that I'm doing off of, and for me it's FULLY customizable because it's all custom code!</p>\r\n<p>Now, isn't this too much?</p>\r\n<p>Aren't you only supposed to pick one profession, one skill in life and stick with that?</p>\r\n<p>FUCK NO. You only have one life, and life is huge! Sure, there are some things that are probably smarter to invest in at first before you don the other things, but find what is meaningful and useful to you and in your life and do that!</p>\r\n<p>For me, that includes:&lt;ol&gt;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Spending time with my loved ones and building my relationships, as well as growing in amazing friends and network.</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Taking care of my health and consuming healthy foods</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Playing the best videogames (mostly RPGs and CCGs for me), but doing it in a way that can also make you money by streaming, which requires a laptop that can handle it, which requires money, unless you can twitch stream from your phone... hmm.</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Travelling and moving from Airbnb to Airbnb, or investing in real estate and interior designing to your tastes, your architectural style, etc.</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Learn how to start a business (like a Freelancing Business for example, just to start), and learn things like how to lead &amp; manage a team, delegate tasks, earn clients, and make money with a team that you brought together and love.</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Create music, and as you build your automation skills with programming, you can do things like automatically publish it on soundcloud, host it on your website (which I do plan on doing), etc. And play literally ANY instrument by using a cool tool like the ROLI Seaboard/other boards they have (they're not a sponsor, just go and check them out. I really wish they were a sponsor though, so if you can help me out with that that'd be great).</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Start gardening and build a healthy garden, or whatever kind of garden your interested that is also useful and meaningful to you.</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Make an amazing family with the most beautiful and connected partner you've ever met in your life (for me, that's my perfect woman Olga).</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Learn Herbalism more like you did when you were younger (ok, that was just my experience and I still love the idea of being a real life Witch Doctor).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&lt;/ol&gt;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The point is, there are so many options out there.</p>\r\n<p>I know what it's like to be in a shitty spot, and yes, money is a huge part of it.</p>\r\n<p>But living a rich life is about doing things that you enjoy and that interest you, even if that means putting all of your time into one thing!</p>\r\n<p>I'm good at a lot of shit, but not because I isolate on certain skills all the time, because I choose to think about life in a way that brings everything, and the right things, the things that are most important to me, together!</p>\r\n<p>Also, my mentor Ryan Donaldson taught me something called Criteria for Success in life.</p>\r\n<p>I'll make another post on that most likely, but I'm going to list mine for later reference:&lt;ol&gt;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Improved Health</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Increased Freedom</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Relationship Fulfillment</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Massive Positive World Impact</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Increased Creation Capacity</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; Increased Feelings of Joy</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>As long as the actions I'm doing are moving me forward in each of these areas, that's my definition of a rich &amp; meaningful life.</p>\r\n<p>Another way of putting it is this: Dive into areas that interest you and move closer to something I'm proud to be able to quite Rick Sanchez on:</p>\r\n<p>\"Ability to do anything, but only whenever I want... Yeah that sounds like the job for me.\"</p>\r\n<p>Keep living your life to the fullest, whatever that looks like for you.</p>\r\n<p>And since your here, what are some things that you haven't been doing that you'd like to add back into your life to make it more rich? I'd love to read this. Let me know in the comments below.</p>\r\n<p>I love you guys. Thank you for reading.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
